```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
Seed_Results <- read_csv("Seed Results.csv",show_col_types = FALSE)

Seed_Results |> 
  ggplot(aes(x=`WIN%`,y=F4))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(title="Win Percentage vs. Final Fours by Seed", x="Win Percentage by Seed",y="Final Fours Reached")
```

On this graph, we can see that higher seeds have reached many more final fours than lower seeds in march madness tournaments.
