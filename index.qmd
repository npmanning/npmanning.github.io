Welcome to my website!

Here's a little about me: I am a sophomore at Pomona College, and I study Statistics. In my free time I like to play soccer, basketball and ski. I am on the 5C ski team, and I also enjoy cooking and watching movies. I am originally from Kennebunk, Maine, and I have a sister and two dogs.
